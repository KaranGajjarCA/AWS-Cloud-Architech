Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- It's measure of time, how many hours application take to recover after a disaster happens.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- It's a measurement of maximum amount of data loss when disaster occurs, measured in hour

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    - minimum RTO for single AZ outage recovers in a couple of minutes if muliti AZ deployment is on.
    - It will automatically switch different AZ which is already running and all backups are there.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    - minimum RTO for a single region outage takes around 5 min or more depend on database size.
    - we just need to deploy and bring read replica in different region as primary instance

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    - in Multi-AZ deployment, automatic backup are enable, in this case aws create snapsot of your database once a day.
    - aws will create log backup every 5 min.
    - beacuse of all above backups and snapshots RPO for this senario is around 5 min.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    - Read replica that available in another region is sync with primary database.
    - just take time to setup as primary instance. that would be done within 5-10 min.
    - RPO in this case would be approx 10 minute.
